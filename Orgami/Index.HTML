    <p><i> Interesting facts about Teddy bears</i></p>
    <ul>
<li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
<li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign 'Teddy's bear' and left it in their shop window</li>
<li>Teddy bears have a depth of character that other toys don't have, and in playing with one a child brings it to life.</li>
